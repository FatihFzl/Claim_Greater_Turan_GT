# Emblems used in the CoA designer.
# The order defines the order in which they are listed.
#
# Format:
# filename = {
#     # How many colors options to show for this emblem. Optional, will assume maximum number of colors if missing
#     colors = 3
#
#     # Whether to show the emblem in the CoA designer. Default yes.
#     # Add an entry with no to allow specifying number of colors for emblems used in adjusted mode
#     visible = no
# }
#
#
# Use the count_unique_emblem_colors console command to generate this instead of manually doing the tedium
# Note that the command does NOT preserve your visible definitions, so you'll want to add them back in yourself, use a diff tool to make it easier

# Possible categories:
# abstract
# animals
# circles_spirals
# crosses_and_knots
# faiths
# manmade
# nature
# patterns
# tribal_seal
# writing
# figures

# Double underscore intentional to make it the first option in the list
